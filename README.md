# London-Bike-Rides-Analysis

London Bike Rides Visualization Project with Tableau

Overview:
This project utilizes Tableau to visualize bike ride data from London, aiming to provide insightful visualizations on bike usage patterns, popular routes, and other notable trends. The primary objective is to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards that effectively communicate key insights derived from the data.

Data Sources:
The core data source for this project is the dataset provided by Transport for London (TfL), containing comprehensive information on bike rides across London. The dataset encompasses attributes such as ride duration, start and end locations, timestamps, and user demographics. Additionally, supplementary datasets such as weather data or demographic information may be integrated to enrich the visualizations.

Project Goals:

Data Preparation: Cleanse and format the dataset for optimal utilization within Tableau, addressing any missing values or inconsistencies.
Dashboard Creation: Develop interactive dashboards using Tableau Desktop, incorporating various visualization techniques such as scatter plots, bar charts, heatmaps, and maps to effectively portray bike ride patterns.
Exploration of Trends: Analyze and visualize bike ride patterns, popular routes, and any noteworthy trends through intuitive and insightful visualizations.
User Interaction: Enhance user engagement by enabling interactivity within the dashboards, allowing users to dynamically explore the data and uncover valuable insights.
Storytelling: Construct compelling narratives within the dashboards to guide users through the data, highlighting key findings and facilitating a deeper understanding of bike ride dynamics in London.
Tools and Technologies:

Visualization Tool: Tableau Desktop
Data Sources: Transport for London (TfL) Data, supplementary datasets
Development Environment: Tableau Desktop
